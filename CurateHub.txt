### Project Description: Detoxify

**Overview:**

Detoxify is a proposed web-based solution aimed at helping users regain control over their online video feeds, specifically targeting platforms like YouTube and Instagram, which can often become overloaded with repetitive or unwanted content based on user history. The goal of Detoxify is to provide users with a method to curate their feeds more effectively, focusing on educational and high-quality content that aligns with their interests.

**Problem Statement:**

Online platforms like YouTube and Instagram use algorithms to tailor content recommendations based on user activity and history. While this can be beneficial for discovering new content, it can also lead to a feed that becomes monotonous or overwhelming. For example, a user might find themselves inundated with videos on a specific topic like real estate or back cracking after interacting with a few related videos. This can make it difficult to find and focus on new, relevant content or learning opportunities.

**Solution:**

Detoxify aims to address this issue by offering a platform where users can select specific interests or technologies they wish to explore, such as DevOps, Rust, or GoLang. The system would then curate and surf their YouTube account to populate their feed with high-quality, popular content related to their selected interests. This would involve:

1. **Interest Selection:** Users select a topic or technology they are interested in learning about.
2. **Content Curation:** Detoxify will navigate and interact with the user's YouTube feed on their behalf, consuming content related to the selected topic.
3. **Feed Transformation:** Over time, the user's feed will be populated with content related to their selected interests, improving the relevance of their recommendations and helping them focus on their learning goals.

**Feasibility and Implementation:**

The core challenges include:

- **API Access:** Determining whether YouTube and Instagram provide APIs that allow for such interaction with user feeds and content. Many platforms have APIs that offer limited access, but full control over user feeds may not be supported.
- **Permissions and Security:** Ensuring user privacy and security while interacting with their accounts. This involves handling permissions carefully and potentially dealing with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **User Comfort:** Addressing user concerns regarding account credentials. Offering options like creating separate dummy accounts for interaction could be a workaround if direct access is not feasible.

**Business Model:**

- **Subscription Model:** Users could be charged a subscription fee, for example, $10 per month, to access the Detoxify service. The value proposition would be a more focused and educational feed, leading to enhanced learning and productivity.
- **Scalability:** The concept could be expanded to other platforms with similar feed algorithms, such as Instagram or even Twitter, to offer a broader detoxification service.

**Conclusion:**

Detoxify represents an innovative approach to managing and curating online content. By leveraging user-selected interests to transform their feed, the platform could enhance learning and content discovery while addressing the problem of content overload. The project would require careful exploration of platform APIs, user permissions, and security measures to ensure successful implementation and user satisfaction.

//---------------------------------------------------------GITHUB CODE PUSH COMMIT FIRST-----------------------------------------------------------

Here’s a step-by-step guide to pushing your code to GitHub:

### **Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository**

If you haven’t already, initialize a Git repository in your project directory:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Initialize the repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

### **Step 2: Add Remote Repository**

Add your GitHub repository as a remote:

1. Copy the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`).
2. Add the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

### **Step 3: Stage and Commit Your Changes**

1. **Stage all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This stages all files in your project directory for commit.

2. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial setup with working backend API for recommendations"
   ```

### **Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub**

1. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace `main` with the default branch name if it’s different (e.g., `master`).

### **Step 5: Verify on GitHub**

1. Go to your GitHub repository in your web browser.
2. Check to ensure that your commits and files are visible and up-to-date.

### **Optional: Set Up Branches**

If you plan to work on additional features, you might want to create branches:

Certainly! The aim of the **CurateHub** project is to help users regain control over their online video feeds, particularly on platforms like YouTube and Instagram, which can often become overloaded with repetitive or unwanted content. 

**Goals:**
- **Content Curation:** Allow users to specify their interests or topics they want to explore. 
- **Feed Transformation:** Curate and transform their feed to focus on high-quality, educational, and relevant content based on their selected interests.
- **Improved Discovery:** Enhance the relevance of recommendations to help users find and engage with content that aligns with their learning and personal development goals.

By achieving these goals, **CurateHub** aims to provide a more focused and productive content discovery experience for users.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s get started with the development phase. Here’s how to approach it step-by-step:

### **1. Define New Features or Improvements**

Before coding, clearly define the features or improvements you want to add. For example:
- **Enhanced Recommendation Engine:** Improve the algorithm for better content recommendations.
- **User Interface Enhancements:** Make the UI more intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Additional Integrations:** Add support for other platforms or APIs.

### **2. Set Up Development Environment**

Ensure your development environment is ready:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### **3. Implement New Features**

#### **Example Feature: Enhanced Recommendation Engine**

1. **Update Codebase:**
   - **Locate the Recommendation Logic:** Find where the current recommendation logic is implemented.
   - **Improve Algorithm:** Enhance the algorithm or integrate a more sophisticated recommendation engine.
   - **Update Endpoints:** Ensure that the API endpoints reflect the new recommendation logic.

2. **Code Example:**
   ```python
   # Example of enhanced recommendation logic
   def get_recommendations(user_interests):
       # Enhanced algorithm to provide better recommendations
       # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
       recommendations = []
       for interest in user_interests:
           # Fetch and process content related to the interest
           content = fetch_content(interest)
           recommendations.extend(content)
       return sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x['popularity'], reverse=True)
   ```

### **4. Test New Features**

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Create or update unit tests to cover the new features.
   - Run tests to ensure functionality.

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test how the new features work with existing parts of the application.

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Verify the features manually to check if they meet your expectations.

### **5. Update Documentation**

1. **README.md:**
   - Add information about the new features and how to use them.

2. **Other Documentation:**
   - Update any other relevant documentation to reflect changes.

### **6. Commit and Push Changes**

1. **Stage Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added [feature] and improved [aspect]"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

### **7. Monitor and Iterate**

1. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Keep an eye on the performance and usage of the new features.

2. **Iterate:**
   - Make adjustments and improvements based on feedback and performance.

**Let’s start with the specific feature or improvement you want to implement.** If you have a particular feature in mind, let me know so we can break it down and get started!

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Development Plan: Recommendation Logic**

#### **1. Implement Recommendation Logic**

**File to Modify:**
- **Path:** `src/recommendation_logic.py`

**Tasks:**
1. **Define Recommendation Algorithm:** Implement the core logic for recommending content based on user interests.
2. **Integrate with Backend:** Ensure that the recommendation logic is correctly integrated with the existing backend functionality.

**Steps:**
1. **Create a new file for the recommendation logic** if it doesn't already exist:
   - **Path:** `src/recommendation_logic.py`

2. **Define the Recommendation Function:** Implement the function that will handle the recommendation logic.

   ```python
   # src/recommendation_logic.py

   def recommend_content(user_interests):
       """
       Recommend content based on user interests.
       
       Parameters:
       user_interests (list of str): List of user-selected interests or topics.
       
       Returns:
       list of dict: List of recommended content with titles.
       """
       # Placeholder logic for demonstration
       recommendations = []
       for interest in user_interests:
           # Example: Generate recommendations based on interest
           recommendations.append({
               "title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"
           })
           recommendations.append({
               "title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 2"
           })
       return recommendations
   ```

3. **Integrate the Logic in `app.py`:**

   **File to Modify:**
   - **Path:** `app.py`

   **Code Integration:**
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   from src.recommendation_logic import recommend_content

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['GET'])
   def get_recommendations():
       interests = request.args.getlist('interests')
       recommendations = recommend_content(interests)
       return jsonify({"recommendations": recommendations})
   ```

#### **2. Define Expected Output**

**Example Expected Output:**

If the user’s interests are `["Python", "Data Science"]`, the expected output might be:

```json
{
    "recommendations": [
        {"title": "Recommended video for Python 1"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Python 2"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 1"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 2"}
    ]
}
```

#### **3. Write Test Cases**

**File to Create:**
- **Path:** `tests/test_recommendation_logic.py`

**Example Test Cases:**

```python
# tests/test_recommendation_logic.py

import unittest
from src.recommendation_logic import recommend_content

class TestRecommendationLogic(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_recommend_content(self):
        # Test case with sample interests
        interests = ["Python", "Data Science"]
        expected_output = [
            {"title": "Recommended video for Python 1"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Python 2"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 1"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 2"}
        ]
        result = recommend_content(interests)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### **Summary:**

1. **Implement Recommendation Logic:**
   - **File:** `src/recommendation_logic.py`
   - **Function:** `recommend_content(user_interests)`

2. **Integrate with Backend:**
   - **File:** `app.py`
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/recommendations`

3. **Define Expected Output:**
   - Based on sample interests.

4. **Write Test Cases:**
   - **File:** `tests/test_recommendation_logic.py`
   - **Test Function:** `test_recommend_content`

Let me know if you need any additional details or if you’re ready to proceed with these steps!

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Testing the Recommendation Logic**

**Steps:**

1. **Ensure Dependencies Are Installed:**
   Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed for running tests and the Flask application. If not already installed, you can add them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Tests:**

   **Command to Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

   This command will discover and run all the tests in the `tests` directory.

3. **Verify Test Results:**
   Check the output of the test run. You should see results indicating whether your tests passed or failed. If any tests fail, review the error messages to debug the issue.

4. **Run the Flask Application:**

   **Command to Start Flask Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Make sure the Flask application is running before making API requests.

5. **Test the API Endpoint:**

   **Using Postman:**
   - Open Postman and create a new request.
   - Set the request type to `GET`.
   - Enter the URL for the endpoint, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/recommendations?interests=Python&interests=Data%20Science`.
   - Click `Send` and verify the response matches the expected output.

### **Expected Output from API:**

For the request with interests `["Python", "Data Science"]`, you should see a response like:

```json
{
    "recommendations": [
        {"title": "Recommended video for Python 1"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Python 2"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 1"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 2"}
    ]
}
```

Let me know if you encounter any issues during testing or if you need further assistance!

(venv) G:\E_drive_data\GitHubProjects\CurateHub\CurateHub>python -m unittest discover -s tests
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should place the combined `app.py` file in the `src` directory:

**Path:** `G:\E_drive_data\GitHubProjects\CurateHub\CurateHub\src\app.py`

This structure makes sense because the `src` directory typically contains the source code of the application. The `backend` folder can then be removed or repurposed as needed. 

Once placed in the `src` directory, make sure to update any references to the `app.py` file in your project setup or testing scripts.

It looks like everything is working perfectly! Here's a summary:

1. **Unit Test**: The test in `tests/test_recommendation_logic.py` passed successfully.
2. **API Testing**: 
   - The `/test` endpoint returned the expected response: `{"message": "GET method works!"}`.
   - The home page at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` should also be accessible without issues.

### Next Steps
- If everything is functioning as expected, you can decide whether to push these updates to GitHub or proceed with adding more features to the project.
- If you want to push the changes, just let me know!
