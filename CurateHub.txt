### Project Description: Detoxify

**Overview:**

Detoxify is a proposed web-based solution aimed at helping users regain control over their online video feeds, 
specifically targeting platforms like YouTube and Instagram, which can often become overloaded with repetitive or 
unwanted content based on user history. The goal of Detoxify is to provide users with a method to curate their feeds 
more effectively, focusing on educational and high-quality content that aligns with their interests.

**Problem Statement:**

Online platforms like YouTube and Instagram use algorithms to tailor content recommendations based on user activity and history. While this can be beneficial for discovering new content, it can also lead to a feed that becomes monotonous or overwhelming. For example, a user might find themselves inundated with videos on a specific topic like real estate or back cracking after interacting with a few related videos. This can make it difficult to find and focus on new, relevant content or learning opportunities.

**Solution:**

Detoxify aims to address this issue by offering a platform where users can select specific interests or technologies 
they wish to explore, such as DevOps, Rust, or GoLang. 
The system would then curate and surf their YouTube account to populate their feed with high-quality, 
popular content related to their selected interests. This would involve:

1. **Interest Selection:** Users select a topic or technology they are interested in learning about.
2. **Content Curation:** Detoxify will navigate and interact with the user's YouTube feed on their behalf, consuming content related to the selected topic.
3. **Feed Transformation:** Over time, the user's feed will be populated with content related to their selected interests, improving the relevance of their recommendations and helping them focus on their learning goals.

**Feasibility and Implementation:**

The core challenges include:

- **API Access:** Determining whether YouTube and Instagram provide APIs that allow for such interaction with user feeds and content. Many platforms have APIs that offer limited access, but full control over user feeds may not be supported.
- **Permissions and Security:** Ensuring user privacy and security while interacting with their accounts. This involves handling permissions carefully and potentially dealing with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **User Comfort:** Addressing user concerns regarding account credentials. Offering options like creating separate dummy accounts for interaction could be a workaround if direct access is not feasible.

**Business Model:**

- **Subscription Model:** Users could be charged a subscription fee, for example, $10 per month, to access the Detoxify service. The value proposition would be a more focused and educational feed, leading to enhanced learning and productivity.
- **Scalability:** The concept could be expanded to other platforms with similar feed algorithms, such as Instagram or even Twitter, to offer a broader detoxification service.

**Conclusion:**

Detoxify represents an innovative approach to managing and curating online content. By leveraging user-selected interests to transform their feed, the platform could enhance learning and content discovery while addressing the problem of content overload. The project would require careful exploration of platform APIs, user permissions, and security measures to ensure successful implementation and user satisfaction.

       # Enhanced algorithm to provide better recommendations
       # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
       recommendations = []
       for interest in user_interests:
           # Fetch and process content related to the interest
           content = fetch_content(interest)
           recommendations.extend(content)
       return sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x['popularity'], reverse=True)
   ```

### **4. Test New Features**

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Create or update unit tests to cover the new features.
   - Run tests to ensure functionality.

---

**Let’s start with the specific feature or improvement you want to implement.** If you have a particular feature in mind, let me know so we can break it down and get started!

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Development Plan: Recommendation Logic**

#### **1. Implement Recommendation Logic**

**File to Modify:**
- **Path:** `src/recommendation_logic.py`

**Tasks:**
1. **Define Recommendation Algorithm:** Implement the core logic for recommending content based on user interests.
2. **Integrate with Backend:** Ensure that the recommendation logic is correctly integrated with the existing backend functionality.

**Steps:**
1. **Create a new file for the recommendation logic** if it doesn't already exist:
   - **Path:** `src/recommendation_logic.py`

2. **Define the Recommendation Function:** Implement the function that will handle the recommendation logic.

   ```python
   # src/recommendation_logic.py

   def recommend_content(user_interests):
       """
       Recommend content based on user interests.
       
       Parameters:
       user_interests (list of str): List of user-selected interests or topics.
       
       Returns:
       list of dict: List of recommended content with titles.
       """
       # Placeholder logic for demonstration
       recommendations = []
       for interest in user_interests:
           # Example: Generate recommendations based on interest
           recommendations.append({
               "title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"
           })
           recommendations.append({
               "title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 2"
           })
       return recommendations
   ```

3. **Integrate the Logic in `app.py`:**

   **File to Modify:**
   - **Path:** `app.py`

   **Code Integration:**
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   from src.recommendation_logic import recommend_content

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['GET'])
   def get_recommendations():
       interests = request.args.getlist('interests')
       recommendations = recommend_content(interests)
       return jsonify({"recommendations": recommendations})
   ```

#### **2. Define Expected Output**

**Example Expected Output:**

If the user’s interests are `["Python", "Data Science"]`, the expected output might be:

```json
{
    "recommendations": [
        {"title": "Recommended video for Python 1"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Python 2"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 1"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 2"}
    ]
}
```

#### **3. Write Test Cases**

**File to Create:**
- **Path:** `tests/test_recommendation_logic.py`

**Example Test Cases:**

```python
# tests/test_recommendation_logic.py

import unittest
from src.recommendation_logic import recommend_content

class TestRecommendationLogic(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_recommend_content(self):
        # Test case with sample interests
        interests = ["Python", "Data Science"]
        expected_output = [
            {"title": "Recommended video for Python 1"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Python 2"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 1"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 2"}
        ]
        result = recommend_content(interests)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### **Summary:**

1. **Implement Recommendation Logic:**
   - **File:** `src/recommendation_logic.py`
   - **Function:** `recommend_content(user_interests)`

2. **Integrate with Backend:**
   - **File:** `app.py`
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/recommendations`

3. **Define Expected Output:**
   - Based on sample interests.

4. **Write Test Cases:**
   - **File:** `tests/test_recommendation_logic.py`
   - **Test Function:** `test_recommend_content`

Let me know if you need any additional details or if you’re ready to proceed with these steps!

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Testing the Recommendation Logic**

**Steps:**

1. **Ensure Dependencies Are Installed:**
   Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed for running tests and the Flask application. If not already installed, you can add them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Tests:**

   **Command to Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

   This command will discover and run all the tests in the `tests` directory.

3. **Verify Test Results:**
   Check the output of the test run. You should see results indicating whether your tests passed or failed. If any tests fail, review the error messages to debug the issue.

4. **Run the Flask Application:**

   **Command to Start Flask Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Make sure the Flask application is running before making API requests.

5. **Test the API Endpoint:**

   **Using Postman:**
   - Open Postman and create a new request.
   - Set the request type to `GET`.
   - Enter the URL for the endpoint, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/recommendations?interests=Python&interests=Data%20Science`.
   - Click `Send` and verify the response matches the expected output.

### **Expected Output from API:**

For the request with interests `["Python", "Data Science"]`, you should see a response like:

```json
{
    "recommendations": [
        {"title": "Recommended video for Python 1"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Python 2"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 1"},
        {"title": "Recommended video for Data Science 2"}
    ]
}
```

Let me know if you encounter any issues during testing or if you need further assistance!

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should place the combined `app.py` file in the `src` directory:

**Path:** `G:\E_drive_data\GitHubProjects\CurateHub\CurateHub\src\app.py`

This structure makes sense because the `src` directory typically contains the source code of the application. The `backend` folder can then be removed or repurposed as needed. 

Once placed in the `src` directory, make sure to update any references to the `app.py` file in your project setup or testing scripts.

   - Verify that all new functionalities work as intended with thorough testing.

3. **Code Review and Push**: 
   - Review the code for any improvements or optimizations before pushing changes to GitHub.

Would you like to start with a specific feature or area from the steps above?

Understood. Here's how we can proceed with feature development while ensuring stability:

### Feature Development Plan

1. **Feature Design**:
   - For each new feature, design its functionality clearly, outlining how it integrates with existing features.

2. **Modular Code**:
   - Develop new features in a modular way. Encapsulate new functionality into separate modules or functions where possible to minimize impact on existing code.

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the new feature independently and then integrate it with the existing system. Ensure that it works as expected without disrupting current functionality.

4. **Regression Testing**:
   - After integrating the new feature, perform regression testing to verify that existing features still function correctly.

5. **Version Control**:
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage changes. Create a new branch for each feature, develop and test it in isolation, and then merge it into the main branch after testing.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect new features and any changes to existing functionalities.

### Next Steps:

1. **Define Next Feature**:
   - Identify the next feature to be developed and create a detailed design plan.

2. **Update the Codebase**:
   - Implement the feature in a modular fashion. Update any existing code if needed while keeping changes minimal.

3. **Test the New Feature**:
   - Write test cases to verify the new feature and ensure it integrates well with the existing system.

4. **Perform Regression Testing**:
   - Run tests to ensure existing features are not affected.

5. **Push Changes**:
   - Once everything is tested and verified, push the changes to the GitHub repository.

Would you like to proceed with a specific feature or need help with the next steps?

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It looks like you only need to manage one `app.py` file in the `src` directory, which combines both GET and POST methods for recommendations and includes a test route. Since the `backend` folder and its `app.py` file no longer exist, we can focus on updating and testing the single `src/app.py` file.

### Updated `src/app.py` File:

Here’s a combined and updated version of your `app.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Home route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to CurateHub!"

# GET method for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['GET'])
def get_recommendations_get():
    interests = request.args.getlist('interests')
    recommendations = [
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"} for interest in interests
    ]
    return jsonify({'recommendations': recommendations})

# POST method for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['POST'])
def get_recommendations_post():
    data = request.json
    interest = data.get('interest')
    recommendations = [
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"},
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 2"}
    ]
    return jsonify({"recommendations": recommendations})

# Test route
@app.route('/test', methods=['GET'])
def test():
    return jsonify({'message': 'GET method works!'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Next Steps:

1. **Implement the New Feature**:
   - Let me know what feature you would like to implement next, or if you need suggestions, I can provide them.

2. **Update the Code**:
   - Based on the feature you want to add, we will update the existing `app.py` file accordingly.

3. **Testing**:
   - After implementing the feature, we will run tests to ensure everything works correctly.

4. **Document Changes**:
   - Document the changes made and update any related documentation.

5. **Commit and Push**:
   - Once everything is tested and documented, we’ll commit the changes and push them to GitHub.

Please let me know the next feature or changes you have in mind, and we’ll proceed with integrating them into the code.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! Here’s how we can proceed, ensuring we align with the previously established design principles and flow:

### **1. Feature Identification and Planning**

**New Feature:** Add a search functionality to filter recommendations by keywords.

- **Description:** Users can filter recommendations by providing keywords in their requests.

### **2. Code Update and Integration**

**Files to Update:**
1. **`src/app.py`** - Update to include a search functionality.

Here’s how we can modify the `src/app.py` file to include this new feature:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Home route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to CurateHub!"

# GET method for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['GET'])
def get_recommendations_get():
    interests = request.args.getlist('interests')
    search_keyword = request.args.get('search', '')
    recommendations = [
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"} for interest in interests if search_keyword.lower() in f"Recommended video for {interest} 1".lower()
    ]
    return jsonify({'recommendations': recommendations})

# POST method for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['POST'])
def get_recommendations_post():
    data = request.json
    interest = data.get('interest')
    search_keyword = data.get('search', '')
    recommendations = [
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"},
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 2"}
    ]
    filtered_recommendations = [rec for rec in recommendations if search_keyword.lower() in rec['title'].lower()]
    return jsonify({"recommendations": filtered_recommendations})

# Test route
@app.route('/test', methods=['GET'])
def test():
    return jsonify({'message': 'GET method works!'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### **3. Testing**

**Test Cases:**

1. **Test Case for GET method with Search Keyword**
    - **Input:** URL with query parameters: `?interests=Python&search=1`
    - **Expected Output:** Recommendations including "1" in the title.

2. **Test Case for POST method with Search Keyword**
    - **Input:** JSON body: `{"interest": "Python", "search": "2"}`
    - **Expected Output:** Recommendations including "2" in the title.

**Test File: `tests/test_recommendation_logic.py`**

Here’s how you can add test cases to `tests/test_recommendation_logic.py`:

```python
import unittest
from app import app

class RecommendationTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.app = app.test_client()
        cls.app.testing = True
    
    def test_get_recommendations_with_search(self):
        response = self.app.get('/api/recommendations?interests=Python&search=1')
        data = response.get_json()
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTrue(any("1" in rec["title"] for rec in data['recommendations']))
    
    def test_post_recommendations_with_search(self):
        response = self.app.post('/api/recommendations', json={"interest": "Python", "search": "2"})
        data = response.get_json()
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTrue(any("2" in rec["title"] for rec in data['recommendations']))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your test case for the recommendation logic looks well-structured. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to proceed with integrating this test and running it:

### **1. Ensure `recommend_content` Function Exists**

Ensure that the `recommend_content` function is correctly defined in `src/recommendation_logic.py`. It should be something like this:

```python
def recommend_content(interests):
    recommendations = []
    for interest in interests:
        recommendations.extend([
            {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"},
            {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 2"}
        ])
    return recommendations
```

### **2. Update the Test File**

Make sure your test file `tests/test_recommendation_logic.py` is placed correctly and matches the following:

```python
import unittest
from src.recommendation_logic import recommend_content

class TestRecommendationLogic(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_recommend_content(self):
        # Test case with sample interests
        interests = ["Python", "Blockchain"]
        expected_output = [
            {"title": "Recommended video for Python 1"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Python 2"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Blockchain 1"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Blockchain 2"}
        ]
        result = recommend_content(interests)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### **3. Run the Tests**

Navigate to the `tests` directory and run the test using:

```bash
python -m unittest test_recommendation_logic
```

### **4. Verify Output**

Ensure the output matches the expected results. If the test passes, it will confirm that your recommendation logic is functioning as expected.

### **5. Next Steps**

- **Integrate Changes:** If the test passes, integrate the `recommend_content` logic into your `src/app.py` as needed.
- **Document Changes:** Update any documentation if the recommendation logic changes.
- **Push Code:** Once everything is verified, push the changes to GitHub.

If you encounter any issues or need additional help, feel free to ask!


The error you're encountering indicates that the `src` module cannot be found. This usually means that Python is not able to locate the `src` directory in your project's structure. Here’s how you can fix this:

### **1. Check `PYTHONPATH`**

Ensure that the `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly to include the `src` directory. You can set the `PYTHONPATH` temporarily for your test session:

```bash
set PYTHONPATH=G:\E_drive_data\GitHubProjects\CurateHub\CurateHub
```

### **2. Modify the Test Script**

You can modify the `test_recommendation_logic.py` to use relative imports. For instance:

```python
import unittest
from recommendation_logic import recommend_content  # Remove 'src.' if running directly

class TestRecommendationLogic(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_recommend_content(self):
        # Test case with sample interests
        interests = ["Python", "Blockchain"]
        expected_output = [
            {"title": "Recommended video for Python 1"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Python 2"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Blockchain 1"},
            {"title": "Recommended video for Blockchain 2"}
        ]
        result = recommend_content(interests)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### **3. Run the Test**

Navigate to the `tests` directory and run:

```bash
python -m unittest test_recommendation_logic
```

### **4. Check Directory Structure**

Ensure your directory structure looks like this:

```
CurateHub/
├── src/
│   ├── app.py
│   └── recommendation_logic.py
└── tests/
    └── test_recommendation_logic.py
```

### **5. Verify Import**

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can verify if `recommendation_logic.py` is correctly placed in the `src` directory and that the directory is being recognized correctly. 

Let me know if these steps help or if you need further assistance!

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature_1:
User Profiles and Preferences
Description: Allow users to create profiles where they can save their preferences, watch history, and liked content.
Impact: High. This enables personalized recommendations tailored to each user’s interests and behavior.
Priority: High.

Great! Let's proceed with developing the "User Profiles and Preferences" feature for CurateHub. 
Here’s a general outline of what we can do:

1. **User Profiles**:
   - Create a model or database structure to store user profiles.
   - Include fields like username, email, password (hashed), preferences, watch history, and liked content.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Use authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure login sessions.

3. **User Preferences**:
   - Allow users to save their content preferences, such as favorite categories or interests.
   - Modify the recommendation logic to consider these preferences for personalized content suggestions.

4. **Watch History and Liked Content**:
   - Track the content users have watched and liked.
   - Update the recommendation algorithm to incorporate this data.

5. **Profile Management**:
   - Allow users to update their profile information and preferences.
   - Provide an option for users to view and manage their watch history and liked content.

6. **Testing and Integration**:
   - Test the new features using Postman and automated unit tests to ensure they work correctly.
   - Integrate the new functionality with the existing codebase.



Let's begin with setting up the user profile model and authentication system. Since we're working with Flask, we'll need to integrate a database to store user information and use a library like `Flask-JWT-Extended` for authentication.

### Step 1: Set Up the Database
We'll use SQLite for simplicity, but this can be easily switched to another database like PostgreSQL or MySQL later.

1. **Install the Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have these installed in your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-JWT-Extended
   ```

2. **Create the User Model**:
   Let's add a `User` model to represent user profiles in the database.

   Please provide the code for `src/app.py`, and I'll add the necessary changes for setting up the `User` model and the database.

   //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Let's modify the `app.py` file to add the `User` model, set up the database, and implement basic user registration. Here's how the updated `src/app.py` will look:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, create_access_token
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration for SQLAlchemy and JWT
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///curatehub.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'

# Initialize extensions
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
jwt = JWTManager(app)

# User model
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    preferences = db.Column(db.String(500), nullable=True)

    def set_password(self, password):
        self.password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)

    def check_password(self, password):
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)

# Home route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to CurateHub!"

# User registration
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data.get('username')
    password = data.get('password')
    email = data.get('email')

    if User.query.filter_by(username=username).first() is not None:
        return jsonify({"error": "Username already exists"}), 400

    new_user = User(username=username, email=email)
    new_user.set_password(password)
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()

    access_token = create_access_token(identity=username)
    return jsonify({"access_token": access_token}), 201

# GET method for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['GET'])
def get_recommendations_get():
    interests = request.args.getlist('interests')
    search_keyword = request.args.get('search', '')
    recommendations = [
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"} for interest in interests
    ]
    return jsonify({'recommendations': recommendations})

# POST method for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['POST'])
def get_recommendations_post():
    data = request.json
    interest = data.get('interest')
    search_keyword = data.get('search', '')
    recommendations = [
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"},
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 2"}
    ]
    filtered_recommendations = [rec for rec in recommendations if search_keyword.lower() in rec['title'].lower()]
    return jsonify({"recommendations": filtered_recommendations})

# Test route
@app.route('/test', methods=['GET'])
def test():
    return jsonify({'message': 'GET method works!'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()  # Creates the database tables
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:

1. **User Model**: 
   - The `User` model includes `username`, `password_hash`, `email`, and `preferences`.
   - It includes methods to set and check passwords securely using `werkzeug.security`.

2. **User Registration Route** (`/register`):
   - This route allows new users to register by providing a `username`, `password`, and `email`.
   - The password is hashed for security, and a JWT access token is returned upon successful registration.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - The `SQLAlchemy` extension is used to interact with the SQLite database.
   - The database is created when the application runs for the first time with `db.create_all()`.

### Next Steps:
1. **Run the Application**: Ensure the application starts without errors and the database is created.
2. **Test User Registration**: You can use Postman to send a `POST` request to `/register` with `username`, `password`, and `email` to test the registration process.
3. **Further Development**: Implement login, profile management, and other features based on the project’s goals.

Would you like to proceed with testing the user registration in Postman?

Secret key generator:

import os
print(os.urandom(24))

The `your_secret_key` in the code is a placeholder for the actual secret key that you should use for your Flask application. The secret key is used by Flask and Flask-JWT-Extended to sign session cookies and tokens, so it's essential for ensuring the security of your application.

### How to Set the Secret Key:
1. **Generate a Secret Key:**
   - You can generate a random secret key in Python using the following command:
     ```python
     import os
     os.urandom(24)
     ```
   - This will give you a random 24-byte key that you can use. For example:
     ```python
     b'\xa4\xcf\xb3\x1f\xad\xf4\x1d\xa9\xd9\xbe\xab\xf7\xbd\xb8\xcf\xba\x17\x9a'
     ```

2. **Set the Secret Key in Your Code:**
   - Replace `your_secret_key` in your `app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY']` with the generated key:
     ```python
     app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = b'\xa4\xcf\xb3\x1f\xad\xf4\x1d\xa9\xd9\xbe\xab\xf7\xbd\xb8\xcf\xba\x17\x9a'
     ```

   - Alternatively, convert the key to a string and use it directly:
     ```python
     app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'a4cfb31fadb71da9d9beabf7bd8cfba17a'
     ```

3. **Environment Variables (Recommended):**
   - For better security, it's recommended to store the secret key in an environment variable and load it in your application:
     ```python
     import os
     app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('JWT_SECRET_KEY', 'default_secret_key')
     ```
   - You can set the environment variable `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in your development or production environment.

This way, you can keep your secret key secure and avoid hardcoding it directly in your source code.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code snippet you've provided is setting up configurations for both SQLAlchemy and JWT in your Flask application. Here's what each configuration does:

1. **SQLAlchemy Configuration**:
   ```python
   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///curatehub.db'
   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
   ```
   - `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: This sets up the URI for your SQLite database, which will be named `curatehub.db` and stored in the root directory of your project.
   - `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS`: This is set to `False` to disable the feature that signals the application every time a change is about to be made in the database, which helps reduce overhead.

2. **JWT Secret Key Configuration**:
   ```python
   app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = b'\xe8\xb1\xb9\xcc\xd3i\xa6\x15\xf2\xe2/j\xd0\x1d\xfe\xb2M\xc7(\x1e\x11\xb0\xa3\xb9'
   ```
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: This key is used to sign JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in your application. The key you've provided is a randomly generated 24-byte key.

### Points to Consider:
- **Database URI**: If you're using SQLite, this setup is fine for a small-scale application or during development. For production, you might want to use a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **JWT Secret Key**: Ensure that this key remains secret and is not shared publicly, as it's critical for the security of your JWT tokens.
- **Environment Variables**: Consider storing sensitive information like the `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in environment variables for enhanced security, especially when deploying to production.

You can now proceed with setting up your models and routes that will utilize this configuration. If you want to continue, you can share the next piece of code or let me know what you'd like to do next.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the next steps:

1. **User Profile Model Implementation**:
   - Implement a user profile model to store user information, preferences, and history in the database.
   - Define the schema for the user profile, including fields like `username`, `email`, `password`, `preferences`, `watch_history`, etc.

2. **User Registration and Authentication**:
   - Implement user registration, login, and authentication functionality.
   - Use JWT for user authentication and ensure secure password storage with hashing.

3. **Integration with Recommendation Logic**:
   - Modify the recommendation logic to utilize user profiles. Recommendations should now be tailored based on user preferences and watch history.

4. **API Endpoints for User Profiles**:
   - Create API endpoints for managing user profiles, such as creating a profile, updating preferences, and fetching user-specific recommendations.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write test cases for the new features, including user registration, authentication, and personalized recommendations.
   - Run tests to ensure everything works as expected.

6. **Database Migration**:
   - If necessary, perform database migrations to accommodate the new user profile model.

7. **Postman Testing**:
   - Use Postman to manually test the new API endpoints and ensure they work as expected.

8. **Documentation**:
   - Update the project documentation to include details about the new features, how to use them, and any specific setup or configuration steps.

Would you like to start with any specific step?

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great! Let’s start with **User Profile Model Implementation**.

### 1. User Profile Model Implementation

**Objective:** Create a user profile model to store user information, preferences, and history in the database.

#### Steps:

1. **Define the User Profile Model**:
   - Create a model for the user profile in your application. This model should include fields such as `username`, `email`, `password`, `preferences`, and `watch_history`.

2. **Update `app.py`**:
   - Add SQLAlchemy setup and define the User model.

3. **Initialize the Database**:
   - Create and initialize the SQLite database with the new User model.

#### Example Implementation:

**1. Define the User Profile Model:**

Create a new file named `models.py` in the `src` directory.

```python
# src/models.py

from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128), nullable=False)
    preferences = db.Column(db.String(500))
    watch_history = db.Column(db.String(500))

    def set_password(self, password):
        self.password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)

    def check_password(self, password):
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)
```

**2. Update `app.py`:**

```python
# src/app.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from src.models import db, User  # Import the database and User model

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration for SQLAlchemy and JWT
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///curatehub.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key_here'

db.init_app(app)

# Home route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to CurateHub!"

# Example route for creating a new user
@app.route('/api/users', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    data = request.json
    username = data.get('username')
    email = data.get('email')
    password = data.get('password')
    user = User(username=username, email=email)
    user.set_password(password)
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'message': 'User created successfully!'})

# Initialize the database
@app.before_first_request
def create_tables():
    db.create_all()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**3. Initialize the Database:**

Run the application to initialize the database and create tables.

```bash
python src/app.py
```

**Testing:**

- Use Postman to test the `POST /api/users` endpoint to ensure that user creation works.

Would you like to proceed with this step, or do you have any modifications or questions before we move on to the next step?

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The error you're encountering indicates that the `db.create_all()` call is happening outside of the application context. This means that Flask is not aware of the current application instance when you're trying to interact with the database.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that the database creation is done within the application context. You can do this by wrapping the `db.create_all()` call inside an application context block.

Here's how to modify the `app.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, create_access_token
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration for SQLAlchemy and JWT
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///curatehub.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
# For testing purposes, I have kept the key publicly available
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = b'\xe8\xb1\xb9\xcc\xd3i\xa6\x15\xf2\xe2/j\xd0\x1d\xfe\xb2M\xc7(\x1e\x11\xb0\xa3\xb9'

# Initialize extensions
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
jwt = JWTManager(app)

# User model
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    preferences = db.Column(db.String(500), nullable=True)

    def set_password(self, password):
        self.password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)

    def check_password(self, password):
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)

# Home route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to CurateHub!"

# User registration
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data.get('username')
    password = data.get('password')
    email = data.get('email')

    if User.query.filter_by(username=username).first() is not None:
        return jsonify({"error": "Username already exists"}), 400

    new_user = User(username=username, email=email)
    new_user.set_password(password)
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()

    access_token = create_access_token(identity=username)
    return jsonify({"access_token": access_token}), 201

# GET method for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['GET'])
def get_recommendations_get():
    interests = request.args.getlist('interests')
    search_keyword = request.args.get('search', '')
    recommendations = [
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"} for interest in interests
    ]
    return jsonify({'recommendations': recommendations})

# POST method for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations', methods=['POST'])
def get_recommendations_post():
    data = request.json
    interest = data.get('interest')
    search_keyword = data.get('search', '')
    recommendations = [
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 1"},
        {"title": f"Recommended video for {interest} 2"}
    ]
    filtered_recommendations = [rec for rec in recommendations if search_keyword.lower() in rec['title'].lower()]
    return jsonify({"recommendations": filtered_recommendations})

# Test route
@app.route('/test', methods=['GET'])
def test():
    return jsonify({'message': 'GET method works!'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()  # Creates the database tables
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Explanation:

- **`with app.app_context():`**: This ensures that the application context is available when `db.create_all()` is called, allowing Flask to properly interact with the database.

Try running the application again with this change. If you encounter any more issues or need further adjustments, let me know!

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To test your Flask application using Postman, follow these steps to verify each endpoint. Here's a guide for testing the `/register` endpoint and other endpoints:

### 1. **Testing the `/register` Endpoint**

#### **Setup:**
- Make sure your Flask application is running.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Open Postman.**

2. **Create a New Request:**
   - Click on the `+` button or `New` to create a new request.

3. **Set Request Type:**
   - Select `POST` from the dropdown menu.

4. **Enter the URL:**
   - Enter `http://127.0.0.1:5000/register` in the request URL field.

5. **Set Headers (if required):**
   - You might need to set the `Content-Type` to `application/json`.
     - Go to the `Headers` tab.
     - Add a key-value pair: `Content-Type: application/json`.

6. **Enter Request Body:**
   - Go to the `Body` tab.
   - Select `raw` and choose `JSON` from the dropdown menu.
   - Enter the following JSON payload:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "testuser",
       "password": "password123",
       "email": "testuser@example.com"
     }
     ```

7. **Send the Request:**
   - Click the `Send` button.
   - Check the response. You should see a JSON response with an `access_token` if the registration is successful.

   **Sample Response:**
   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "<your_access_token_here>"
   }
   ```

### 2. **Testing the `/api/recommendations` Endpoints**

#### **GET Method:**

1. **Create a New Request:**
   - Click on the `+` button or `New` to create a new request.

Next Steps:
Feature Development: We discussed adding features like user profiles, preferences, and analytics.
Testing and Refinement: Ensure all features work as intended and optimize the code.
Deployment Considerations: Prepare the project for deployment, including any necessary configurations.

To prioritize the features, we should start with those that directly impact the core functionality and user experience of the application. Here's a suggested order:

### High-Priority Features:

1. **User Profiles and Preferences**
   - **Description**: Allow users to create and manage their profiles, including saving preferences, watch history, and liked content.

### Immediate Action:
Let's begin by focusing on **User Profiles and Preferences** since it's essential for personalized content recommendations. This will involve:
- Expanding the user model to include more detailed profile information and preferences.
- Implementing routes for updating and retrieving user profiles.
- Modifying the recommendation system to take user preferences into account.

Would you like to start with the implementation of user profiles and preferences?

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can create a new file called `user_profile.py` within the `src` directory to handle the logic for user profiles 
and preferences.

### File Path:
```
src/user_profile.py
```

### Directory Structure:
```
CurateHub/
├── src/
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── models.py
│   └── user_profile.py  # New file for handling user profiles and preferences
├── tests/
│   ├── test_app.py
│   └── test_user_profile.py  # New test file for user profile-related tests
└── ...  # Other project files and directories
```

### Purpose of `user_profile.py`:
- Handle user profile management.
- Implement functionality to update user preferences.
- Integrate this with the existing `User` model from `models.py`.

Let me know when you're ready, and we can start working on the implementation details for `user_profile.py`.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's create the `user_profile.py` file to manage user profiles and preferences. Below is a basic implementation to start with:

### `src/user_profile.py`

```python
from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
from src.models import db, User
from flask_jwt_extended import jwt_required, get_jwt_identity

user_profile_bp = Blueprint('user_profile', __name__)

@user_profile_bp.route('/profile', methods=['GET'])
@jwt_required()
def get_profile():
    current_user = get_jwt_identity()
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=current_user).first()

    if user is None:
        return jsonify({"error": "User not found"}), 404

    return jsonify({
        "username": user.username,
        "email": user.email,
        "preferences": user.preferences
    })

@user_profile_bp.route('/profile/preferences', methods=['PUT'])
@jwt_required()
def update_preferences():
    current_user = get_jwt_identity()
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=current_user).first()

    if user is None:
        return jsonify({"error": "User not found"}), 404

    preferences = request.json.get('preferences')
    user.preferences = preferences
    db.session.commit()

    return jsonify({"message": "Preferences updated successfully"}), 200
```

### Explanation:

1. **Blueprint**: We're using a `Blueprint` called `user_profile_bp` to encapsulate all routes related to user profiles. This keeps our application modular.

2. **`/profile` GET Route**:
   - This route allows the user to retrieve their profile information, including username, email, and preferences.
   - It requires the user to be authenticated with JWT.

3. **`/profile/preferences` PUT Route**:
   - This route allows the user to update their preferences.
   - Again, it requires JWT authentication.

### Integrating `user_profile.py` with `app.py`:

We need to register this blueprint in `app.py` to make these routes available in our application.

### Modify `src/app.py`

Add the following lines to `app.py`:

```python
from src.user_profile import user_profile_bp

# Register the blueprint
app.register_blueprint(user_profile_bp)
```

This will register the routes defined in `user_profile.py` with the main Flask application.

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with testing or if you have any other adjustments you'd like to make!

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great! Your Flask application is up and running. You can now use Postman to test the features. Here’s a summary of the steps you should follow:

### Testing the User Profile Features

#### 1. **Register a User:**
   - **Method:** POST
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/register`
   - **Headers:** Content-Type: application/json
   - **Body:**
     ```json
     {
         "username": "testuser",
         "password": "testpassword",
         "email": "testuser@example.com"
     }
     ```

#### 2. **Get JWT Token:**
   - After registration, you'll receive an access token in the response. Copy this token for authentication in the following requests.

#### 3. **Get User Profile:**
   - **Method:** GET
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/profile`
   - **Headers:** 
     - Authorization: Bearer `<your_access_token>`

#### 4. **Update User Preferences:**
   - **Method:** PUT
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/profile/preferences`
   - **Headers:**
     - Authorization: Bearer `<your_access_token>`
     - Content-Type: application/json
   - **Body:**
     ```json
     {
         "preferences": "Python, Blockchain, AI"
     }
     ```

#### 5. **Verify Updated Preferences:**
   - **Method:** GET
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/profile`
   - **Headers:** 
     - Authorization: Bearer `<your_access_token>`

### Postman Testing Checklist:
1. **Ensure each request is correctly configured** with the appropriate method, URL, headers, and body.
2. **Check the response status and body** to confirm that the operations (registration, profile retrieval, preference update) are working as expected.
3. **Look for any error messages** that may indicate issues with your code or configuration.

Let me know if you encounter any issues or if there's anything else you'd like to work on!

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It looks like you’re trying to send a PUT request to update user preferences, but you’re encountering a 404 error, which means the endpoint doesn’t exist or isn’t recognized by the server.

### Steps to Resolve the 404 Error

1. **Check Endpoint Definition:**
   Ensure that the `/profile/preferences` endpoint is correctly defined in your Flask application. If it’s not defined, you’ll need to add it.

2. **Define the PUT Endpoint:**
   If the endpoint doesn’t exist, you’ll need to define it in your `src/app.py` file. Here's an example of how you can implement a PUT endpoint to update user preferences:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, create_access_token, jwt_required, get_jwt_identity
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration for SQLAlchemy and JWT
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///curatehub.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'

# Initialize extensions
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
jwt = JWTManager(app)

# User model
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    preferences = db.Column(db.String(500), nullable=True)

    def set_password(self, password):

### Testing in Postman

1. **Ensure the Server is Running:**
   Make sure your Flask server is running.

2. **Set Up the Request:**
   - **Method:** PUT
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5000/profile/preferences`
   - **Headers:**
     - `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>` (Replace `<your_jwt_token>` with the actual JWT token received after login.)
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
   - **Body:**
     ```json
     {
         "preferences": "Python, Blockchain, AI"
     }
     ```

3. **Send the Request:**
   Check if the preferences are updated successfully or if there are any errors.

Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance or run into any issues!

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The response you received indicates that the `/profile` endpoint is functioning correctly and returning the expected user profile data. 

### Summary of Response

```json
{
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "preferences": "Python, Blockchain, AI",
    "username": "newuser"
}
```

### Things to Check

1. **JWT Token:**
   - Ensure that the token you used is valid and has not expired.

2. **User Profile Update:**
   - If you made a `PUT` request to update the profile, verify that the preferences were updated as expected.

3. **Testing Other Endpoints:**
   - Test other endpoints like `/api/recommendations`, `/log_activity`, and `/analytics` to ensure everything is working as expected.

### Next Steps

If everything is functioning correctly, you might want to:

1. **Push Code Updates:**
   - Commit and push any changes to your repository.

2. **Add More Features:**
   - Consider adding additional features or improving existing ones based on your project requirements.

3. **Document API:**
   - Document your API endpoints, request/response formats, and any special considerations.
